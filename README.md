Indian Point is the closest nuclear power plant to New York City. 

The first program (findindianpoint.py) asks the user for a date in 2017 (input month and day in MMDD format, where MM and DD are two-digit numbers) and 
tells the user whether or not the event report for that day mentions Indian Point. 

The second program (findtargets.py) locates a 'target.' The user should input a target string. The program then goes through all the event reports for 2017 and finds the dates at which the event report contains the target string. 
The program then outputs those dates -- one per line -- to a file called output.txt. 

The third program (medicalevents.py) looks at two consecutive years' worth of NRC database -- 2017, 2018 -- and tabulates, 
month by month, the number of medical events using nuclear material.
